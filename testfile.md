## PAGE 1 of 3

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment for the engineering, procurement, fabrication, and testing of one (1) Hydrogen Injection Skid. The goal of this project is to provide high-pressure hydrogen enrichment to the main turbine feed line.

## 2. SCOPE OF WORK

The scope includes, but is not limited to:

- Process design and P&amp;ID development.
- Structural steel fabrication and skid coating.
- Installation of all mechanical and electrical tie-ins to the existing facility header (Line 100-H-05).
- Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) at the Contractor's facility.
- Final shipping and offloading at the Site.

## 3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

The equipment shall be designed to meet the following process parameters:

- Fluid: Gaseous Hydrogen (99.9% purity)
- Operating Temperature: -10°C to 60°C.
- Design Pressure: 75 barg.
- Materials of Construction: SS316L (Stainless Steel) for all wetted parts to prevent hydrogen embrittlement.
- Design Factor: 1.5x Operating Pressure.

## 4. BATTERY LIMITS &amp; EXCLUSIONS

The physical boundaries of the Contractor's work are defined as follows:

- Inlet: Upstream of the automated isolation valve V-101.
- Outlet: Downstream of the final discharge check valve CV-205.
- Exclusions: The Contractor is responsible for fabrication and delivery only. All tie-ins, inter-connecting piping, and site integration are excluded from the Contractor's scope and shall be performed by the Owner's site team.

## 5. PROJECT SCHEDULE

To meet the facility shutdown window, the project must adhere to a strict timeline.

- Lead Time: The completed skid shall be delivered to the site within 12 weeks from the date of Purchase Order (PO) issuance.
- Design Phase: All engineering drawings to be completed within 3 weeks.
- Liquidated Damages: $1,000 per day for every day past the 12-week delivery mark.

## 6. DELIVERABLES LIST

The following documentation must be submitted for approval:

1.  Final P&amp;ID and General Arrangement (GA) Drawings.
2.  ASME Pressure Vessel Calculations.
3.  Weld Procedure Specifications (WPS).
4.  Data Sheet specifying a Design Pressure of 90 barg.
